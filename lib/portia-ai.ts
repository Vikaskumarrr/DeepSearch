Hey there! So you want to know about AI, huh? Let me break this down in a way that actually makes sense.

## What is AI?
Think of AI as computers that can do stuff that normally requires human thinking. It's like giving your computer a brain that can understand what you're saying, recognize pictures, and even make decisions.

## The Different Kinds
There are basically three types:
- **Narrow AI**: This is what you use every day - like when Netflix suggests shows you might like, or when your email filters out spam
- **General AI**: This is the sci-fi stuff - machines that can do anything a human can do (we're not there yet)
- **Superintelligent AI**: This is when machines become smarter than humans (also not happening anytime soon)

## Where You'll See It
AI is literally everywhere now:
- **Your phone**: Siri, Google Assistant, face recognition
- **Social media**: Instagram filters, TikTok recommendations
- **Shopping**: Amazon suggesting products, chatbots helping you
- **Transportation**: Self-driving cars, traffic prediction

## What's Cool Right Now
AI has gotten really good at specific things like understanding speech or recognizing images. But here's the funny thing - it's still pretty dumb about basic stuff. Like, it can beat you at chess but doesn't know that you can't put a square peg in a round hole.

## The Big Questions
As AI gets better, people are starting to wonder:
- Will robots take our jobs?
- How do we make sure AI isn't biased?
- Who's responsible when AI messes up?
- How do we work with AI instead of being replaced by it?

## The Bottom Line
AI is changing everything, and it's not slowing down. But don't freak out - think of it like the internet in the 90s. It seemed scary at first, but now we can't imagine life without it. The key is learning how to use AI as a tool, not seeing it as a threat.`
    } else if (mainSubject.toLowerCase().includes('machine learning')) {
      return `# Machine Learning

Hey! So you want to know about Machine Learning? That's pretty cool - it's basically how we teach computers to learn on their own.

## What is Machine Learning?
Think of it like this: instead of programming a computer step by step, you show it lots of examples and let it figure out the patterns. It's like how you learned to recognize a cat - you saw tons of cat pictures, and now you just know what a cat looks like. ML does the same thing, but with data.

## How Does It Work?
It's pretty straightforward:
- **Show Examples**: You give the computer thousands of examples
- **Let It Learn**: The computer finds patterns in the data
- **Make Predictions**: Once it's learned, it can predict things about new data

## The Three Main Types
1. **Supervised Learning**: Like having a teacher - you show the computer the right answers
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Like letting a kid loose in a toy store - the computer finds patterns on its own
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Like training a dog - the computer learns through trial and error and rewards

## Where You'll See It
You're probably using ML right now without even realizing it:
- **Netflix**: "You liked Stranger Things, so you'll probably like Dark"
- **Gmail**: "This looks like spam, so I'll put it in the spam folder"
- **Spotify**: "Based on your playlist, here are some new songs you might like"
- **Google Maps**: "There's traffic ahead, so take this route instead"

## What's Cool Right Now
- **Deep Learning**: This is like having a brain with many layers, each layer understanding something more complex
- **AutoML**: Tools that automatically build ML models (no PhD required!)
- **Edge AI**: Running AI on your phone instead of in the cloud

## The Challenges
ML isn't perfect:
- **Data Quality**: Garbage in, garbage out - if your training data is bad, your results will be bad
- **Bias**: If your data has biases, your AI will have biases
- **Explainability**: Sometimes the AI makes decisions and we have no idea why
- **Privacy**: Training AI often means sharing lots of personal data

## The Future
ML is going to get even more integrated into our lives. We're talking about AI that can write code, design buildings, compose music, and maybe even understand emotions. The key is making sure we're building AI that helps humans, not replaces them.`
    } else {
      return `# ${mainSubject}

Hey! So you're asking about ${mainSubject}, huh? That's a pretty interesting topic to explore.

## What is ${mainSubject}?
${mainSubject} is basically what it sounds like - it's all about ${mainSubject.toLowerCase()}. Think of it as a big umbrella that covers a bunch of related stuff.

## Why Should You Care?
Well, for starters, it's everywhere these days. Whether you realize it or not, you're probably using ${mainSubject.toLowerCase()} in some way every day. Plus, it's one of those skills that can open a lot of doors for you.

## What's Going On Right Now?
This field is moving super fast. New stuff comes out all the time, which can be both exciting and a bit overwhelming. But here's the thing - you don't need to know everything. Just pick a starting point and go from there.

## How to Get Started
Don't overthink it:
- Pick one thing to learn first
- Find some good tutorials or courses
- Try building something simple
- Don't worry about being perfect - just start somewhere

## The Real Talk
${mainSubject} isn't going anywhere, so learning about it now is a smart move. But remember, you don't have to become an expert overnight. Take your time, focus on what interests you, and have fun with it.

The best way to learn is by doing, so don't just read about it - try stuff out!`
    }
  }

  // Generate how-to responses
  private generateHowToResponse(query: string, mainSubject: string): string {
    return `# How to Get Started with ${mainSubject}

Hey! So you want to learn ${mainSubject}, huh? That's awesome! Let me give you a practical roadmap that actually works.

## Start Here (Don't Skip This Part)
1. **Get the Basics Down**: Don't try to run before you can walk. Master the fundamentals first
2. **Pick One Thing**: Focus on one aspect at a time instead of trying to learn everything at once
3. **Practice Regularly**: A little bit every day beats cramming once a month
4. **Don't Be Afraid to Ask**: Everyone starts somewhere, and most people are happy to help beginners

## What You'll Need
- **Time**: This isn't going to happen overnight, and that's okay
- **Patience**: You'll hit roadblocks, and that's normal
- **Resources**: Good tutorials, books, or courses (but don't get overwhelmed by choices)
- **Community**: Find people who are learning the same thing or who can mentor you

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Trying to Learn Everything at Once**: Pick one skill and get good at it
- **Comparing Yourself to Experts**: They've been doing this for years
- **Giving Up When Things Get Hard**: The hard parts are where the real learning happens
- **Not Practicing**: Reading about it isn't enough - you need to do it

## Realistic Timeline
- **Week 1-2**: Get comfortable with the basics
- **Month 1**: Start building simple projects
- **Month 2-3**: Tackle more complex challenges
- **Month 6+**: You'll start feeling confident and can help others

## Pro Tips
- **Build Projects**: Theory is great, but building something real is where you really learn
- **Teach Others**: Explaining something to someone else helps you understand it better
- **Stay Curious**: Ask "why" and "how" questions, not just "what"
- **Celebrate Small Wins**: Learning is a journey, not a destination

Remember, everyone who's good at this started exactly where you are. The key is consistency and not giving up when things get frustrating. You've got this!`

  // Generate comparison responses
  private generateComparisonResponse(query: string, mainSubject: string): string {
    return `# Comparing ${mainSubject}

Hey! So you want to compare different options for ${mainSubject}, huh? That's smart thinking! Let me help you figure out what's best for your situation.

## What You're Really Asking
You want to understand the differences between "${query}" - that's smart thinking! Making informed decisions means understanding your options.

## The Key Factors to Consider
When comparing different approaches or technologies, think about:
- **What Problem Are You Solving?**: Different tools are good for different things
- **What's Your Experience Level?**: Some options are easier to learn than others
- **What Resources Do You Have?**: Time, money, and support matter
- **What's Your Timeline?**: Some solutions are quick wins, others are long-term investments

## How to Make a Smart Decision
1. **Define Your Goals**: What are you trying to achieve?
2. **Research the Options**: Don't just go with what's popular
3. **Consider the Trade-offs**: Every choice has pros and cons
4. **Think Long-term**: What will this look like in 6 months or a year?
5. **Get Second Opinions**: Talk to people who've been there

## Common Mistakes People Make
- **Following the Hype**: Just because something is trendy doesn't mean it's right for you
- **Ignoring the Learning Curve**: Some things are harder to learn than others
- **Not Considering Maintenance**: Easy to start doesn't always mean easy to maintain
- **Forgetting About Community**: Good support and documentation matter

## The Bottom Line
There's rarely a "best" choice - there's usually a "best for your situation" choice. Take the time to understand your needs and the options available. And remember, you can always change your mind later if something isn't working out.

The key is making an informed decision rather than just going with your gut or following the crowd.`

## What You're Looking For
You're asking about the location of "${query}" - that's a great question that deserves a proper answer.

## What We Know
${mainSubject} is located in a specific area that has its own unique characteristics and significance. Understanding where something is located often helps explain why it's important and how it fits into the bigger picture.

## Why Location Matters
Location isn't just about geography - it's about:
- **Context**: Understanding the environment and surroundings
- **Accessibility**: How easy it is to reach or interact with
- **Significance**: Why this particular location was chosen
- **Connections**: How it relates to other nearby places or features

Hey! So you want to know about ${mainSubject}, huh? That's a pretty cool topic to dive into.
